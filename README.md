# GoogleSheets_app
This project is a web-based spreadsheet application that closely mimics the core functionalities of Google Sheets. It includes support for mathematical functions, data entry, data validation, and key UI interactions such as drag-and-drop, formula dependencies, and formatting.

**The ðŸš€ Features which I included are:**

**1. Spreadsheet Interface**

Google Sheets-like UI with a formula bar, toolbar, and grid-based structure.

Drag functionality for cell content, formulas, and selections.

Dynamic cell dependencies for formula updates.

Cell formatting options: bold, italics, font size, color.

Ability to add, delete, and resize rows and columns.

**2. Mathematical Functions**

SUM: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.

AVERAGE: Computes the mean of a range of cells.

MAX: Returns the highest value in a range.

MIN: Returns the lowest value in a range.

COUNT: Counts the number of numeric values in a range.

**3. Data Quality Functions**

TRIM: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from text.

UPPER: Converts text to uppercase.

LOWER: Converts text to lowercase.

REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Removes duplicate rows from a selected range.

FIND_AND_REPLACE: Find and replace specific text in a range.

**4. Data Entry and Validation**

Supports numbers, text, and dates.

Basic data validation to enforce numeric input where applicable.

**5. Testing & User Interaction**

Users can input test data and verify function execution.

Clear visual feedback for function results.

ðŸ”¥ Bonus Features

Support for complex formulas (relative and absolute cell references).

Save and load spreadsheets.

Data visualization (charts and graphs).
